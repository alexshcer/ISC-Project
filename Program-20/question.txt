Design a class Perfect to check if a given number is a perfect number or not. 
[A number is said to be perfect if sum of the factors of the number excluding itself is equal to the original number]

Example: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 (where 1, 2 and 3 are factors of 6, excluding itself)

Some of the members of the class are given below:

Class name: Perfect

Data members/instance variables:
num: to store the number

Methods/Member functions:
Perfect (int nn): parameterized constructor to initialize the data member num=nn
int sum_of_factors(int i): returns the sum of the factors of the number(num), excluding itself, using a recursive technique
void check(): checks whether the given number is perfect by invoking the function sum_of_factors() and displays the result with an appropriate message

Specify the class Perfect giving details of the constructor(), int sum_of_factors(int) and void check(). 
Define a main() function to create an object and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
