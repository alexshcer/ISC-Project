Write a program to declare a single-dimensional array a[] and a square matrix b[][] of size N, where N > 2 and N < 10. Allow the user to input positive integers into the single dimensional array.

Perform the following tasks on the matrix:

    Sort the elements of the single-dimensional array in ascending order using any standard sorting technique and display the sorted elements.
    Fill the square matrix b[][] in the following format:
    If the array a[] = {5, 2, 8, 1} then, after sorting a[] = {1, 2, 5, 8}
    Then, the matrix b[][] would fill as below:

    1 2 5 8
    1 2 5 1
    1 2 1 2
    1 1 2 1

    Display the filled matrix in the above format.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
N = 3
ENTER ELEMENTS OF SINGLE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY: 3 1 7

OUTPUT:
SORTED ARRAY: 1 3 7
FILLED MATRIX

1 3 7
1 3 1
1 1 3

Example 2

INPUT:
N = 13

OUTPUT:
MATRIX SIZE OUT OF RANGE

Example 3

INPUT:
N = 5
ENTER ELEMENTS OF SINGLE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY: 10 2 5 23 6

OUTPUT:
SORTED ARRAY: 2 5 6 10 23
FILLED MATRIX

2 5 6 10 23
2 5 6 10 2
2 5 6 2 5
2 5 2 5 6
2 2 5 6 10
