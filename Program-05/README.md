# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `sort`.
- Step-3 :- Create a method named as `sort` and pass the integer type array `a[]` as parameter. In this function, create a for loop (from 0 to the length of the array), start a inner loop (from 0 to `a.length-1-i`) and check whether `a[j] > a[j + 1]`, if true then swap them if they are not in the desired order. 
- Step-4 :- Create a method named as `main`. In this function, create an integer type array `a[]` and store the elements in it (user input). Call the function `sort` and pass the array `a[]` as the parameter. Print the sorted array. Create a 2-Dimensional array `b[][]` and store the elements of sorted array `a[]` in the required pattern using for-loops. Now print the 2-Dimensional array `b[][]`.
- Step-5 :- END
