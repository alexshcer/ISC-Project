A class Adder has been defined to add any two accepted time.
Example: Time A – 6 hours 35 minutes
                  Time B – 7 hours 45 minutes
          Their sum is – 14 hours 20 minutes ( where 60 minutes = 1 hour)
The details of the members of the class are given below:
Class name	Adder
Data member/instance variable:	
a[ ]	integer array to hold two elements (hours and minutes)
Member
functions/methods:	
Adder( )	constructor to assign 0 to the array elements
void readtime( )	to enter the elements of the array
void addtime( Adder X, Adder Y)	adds the time of the two parameterized objects X and Y and stores the sum in the current calling object
void disptime( )	displays the array elements with an appropriate message (i.e. hours = and minutes = )

Specify the class Adder giving details of the constructor( ), void readtime( ), void addtime(Adder, Adder) and void disptime( ). Define the main( ) function to create objects and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
