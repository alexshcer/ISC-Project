# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `boxes`.
- Step-3 :- Create a method named as `main`. In this function, create a variable named as `n` to store the number of boxes. Check if the number of boxes is greater than 0 and less than 1000 or not, if true then print `Invalid Input` and exit the program. Create an array named as `cartonSizes` to store the various sizes of the boxes. Create a for-loop (from 0 to length of `cartonSizes`) inside which calculate and print the volume of each box size. Print the total volume of all the boxes.
- Step-4 :- END
