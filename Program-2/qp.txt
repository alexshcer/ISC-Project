Write a program to declare a matrix A[][] of order (M x N) where 'M' is the number of rows and 'N' is the number of columns such that the value of 'M' must be greater than 0 and less than 10 and the value of 'N' must be greater than 2 and less than 6. Allow the user to input digits (0 - 7) only at each location, such that each row represents an octal number.

Example:
2	3	1	(decimal equivalent of 1st row = 153 i.e. 2x82 + 3x81 + 1x80)
4	0	5	(decimal equivalent of 2nd row = 261 i.e. 4x82 + 0x81 + 5x80)
1	5	6	(decimal equivalent of 3rd row = 110 i.e. 1x82 + 5x81 + 6x80)

Perform the following tasks on the matrix:

    Display the original matrix.
    Calculate the decimal equivalent for each row and display as per the format given below.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1:

INPUT:
M = 1
N = 3
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 1 4 4

OUTPUT:
FILLED MATRIX	DECIMAL EQUIVALENT
1	4	4	100

Example 2:

INPUT:
M = 3
N = 4
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 1 1 3 7
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 2: 2 1 0 6
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 3: 0 2 4 5

OUTPUT:
FILLED MATRIX	DECIMAL EQUIVALENT
1	1	3	7	607
2	1	0	6	1094
0	2	4	5	165

Example 3:

INPUT:
M = 3
N = 3
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 2 4 8

OUTPUT:
INVALID INPUT

Example 4:

INPUT:
M = 4
N = 6

OUTPUT:
OUT OF RANGE
