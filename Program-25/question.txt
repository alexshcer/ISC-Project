Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either '.', '?' or '!' only. The words may be separated by more than one blank space and are in UPPER CASE.

Perform the following tasks:

    Find the number of words beginning and ending with a vowel.
    Place the words which begin and end with a vowel at the beginning, followed by the remaining words as they occur in the sentence.
