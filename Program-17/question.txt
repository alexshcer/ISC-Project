Design a class ArmNum to check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not.
[A number is said to be Armstrong if sum of its digits raised to the power of length of the number is equal to the number]

Example : 371 = 3³ + 7³ + 1³
1634 = 1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴
54748 = 5⁵ + 4⁵ + 7⁵ + 4⁵ + 8⁵

Thus 371, 1634 and 54748 are all examples of Armstrong numbers.

Some of the members of the class are given below:

Class name : ArmNum

Data members / instance variables:
n : to store the number
l : to store the length of the number

Methods / Member functions:
ArmNum(int nn) : parameterized constructor to initialize the data member n=nn
int sum_pow(int i) : returns the sum of each digit raised to the power of the length of the number using recursive technique eg. 34 will return 32 + 42 (as the length of the number is 2)
void isArmstrong( ) : checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number by invoking the function sum_pow( ) and displays the result with an appropriate message

Specify the class ArmNum giving details of the constructor( ), int sum_pow(int) and void isArmstrong( ). 
Define a main( ) function to create an object and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
