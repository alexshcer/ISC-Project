A Prime-Adam integer is a positive integer (without leading zeros) which is a prime as well as an Adam number.

Prime number: A number which has only two factors, i.e. 1 and the number itself.

Example: 2, 3, 5, 7 ... etc.

Adam number: The square of a number and the square of its reverse are reverse to each other.

Example: If n = 13 and reverse of 'n' = 31, then,

(13)2 = 169

(31)2 = 961 which is reverse of 169

thus 13, is an Adam number.

Accept two positive integers m and n, where m is less than n as user input. Display all Prime-Adam integers that are in the range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them along with the frequency, in the format given below:

Test your program with the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
m = 5
n = 100

OUTPUT:
THE PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS ARE:
11 13 31
FREQUENCY OF PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS IS: 3

Example 2

INPUT:
m = 100
n = 200

OUTPUT:
THE PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS ARE:
101 103 113
FREQUENCY OF PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS IS: 3

Example 3

INPUT:
m = 50
n = 70

OUTPUT:
THE PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS ARE:
NIL
FREQUENCY OF PRIME-ADAM INTEGERS IS: 0

Example 4

INPUT:
m = 700
n = 450

OUTPUT:
INVALID INPUT
