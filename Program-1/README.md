# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Import `java.util.*` package.
- Step-3 :- Create a class named as `prime_adam`.
- Step-4 :- Create a function named as `isPrime` which takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean value. It checks whether the number is prime or not.
- Step-5 :- Create a function named as `reverse` which takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer. It reverses the number.
- Step-6 :- Create a function named as `isAdam` which takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean value. It checks whether the number is Adam or not.
- Step-7 :- Create a function named as `main` to call the methods and print the result.
- Step-8 :- END
