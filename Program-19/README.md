# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `"Rearrange"`.
- Srep-3 :- Create a constructor to initialize the instance variable String *wrd* and *newwrd* with null.
- Step-4 :- Create a *void* method `"readword()"` to accept the word and convert its case to Uppercase.
- Step-5 :- Create a *void* method `"freq_vow_con()"` to count the frequency of vowels and consonants.
- Step-6 :- Create a *void* method `"arrange()"` to arrange the letters by bringing the vowels at the beginning followed by consonants.
- Step-7 :- Create a *void* method `"display()"` to display the original and the rearranged word.
- Step-8 :- Create the `"main"` to make a object and call `"readword()"`, `"freq_vow_con()"`, `"arrange()"`, and `"display()"`.
- Step-9 :- END
