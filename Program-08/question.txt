Write a program to declare a matrix a[][] of order (m Ã— n) where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns such that the values of both 'm' and 'n' must be greater than 2 and less than 10. Allow the user to input integers into this matrix. Perform the following tasks on the matrix:

    Display the original matrix.
    Sort each row of the matrix in ascending order using any standard sorting technique.
    Display the changed matrix after sorting each row.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
M = 4
N = 3

ENTER ELEMENTS OF MATRIX:

11 -2 3
5  16 7
9  0  4
3  1  8

OUTPUT:
ORIGINAL MATRIX

11 -2 3
5  16 7
9  0  4
3  1  8

MATRIX AFTER SORTING ROWS

-2 3 11
5 7 16
0 4 9
1 3 8

Example 2

INPUT:
M = 3
N = 3

ENTER ELEMENTS OF MATRIX

22 5 19
7 36 12
9 13  6

OUTPUT:
ORIGINAL MATRIX

22 5 19
7 36 12
9 13  6

MATRIX AFTER SORTING ROWS

5 19 22
7 12 36
6 9 13

Example 3

INPUT:
M = 11
N = 5

OUTPUT:
MATRIX SIZE OUT OF RANGE.
