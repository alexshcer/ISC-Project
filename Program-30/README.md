# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `ConsCharge`.
- Step-3 :- Declare variables - `word` to store the word and `len` to store the length of the word.
- Step-4 :- Create a constructor named as `ConsCharge` to initialize the variables to default values.
- Step-5 :- Create a method named as `readword` to accept the word in lowercase.
- Step-6 :- Create a method named as `shiftcons` to shift all the consonants of the word at the beginning followed by the vowels.
- Step-7 :- Create a method named as `changeword` to change the case of all occurring consonants of the shifted word to uppercase.
- Step-8 :- Create a method named as `show` to display the original word, shifted word and the changed word.
