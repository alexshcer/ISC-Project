void readword( )	to accept a word in UPPER CASE
void swapchar( )	to interchange/swap the first and last characters of the word in ‘wrd’ and stores the new word in ‘swapwrd’
void sortword( )	sorts the characters of the original word in alphabetical order and stores it in ‘sortwrd’
void display( )	    displays the original word, swapped word and the sorted word

Specify the class SwapSort, giving the details of the constructor( ), void readword( ), void swapchar( ), void sortword( ) and void display( ). Define the main( ) function to create an object and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
