The names of the teams participating in a competition should be displayed on a banner vertically, to accommodate as many teams as possible in a single banner. Design a program to accept the names of N teams, where 2 < N < 9 and display them in vertical order, side by side with a horizontal tab (i.e. eight spaces).

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
N = 3
Team 1: Emus
Team 2: Road Rols
Team 3: Coyote

OUTPUT:
E        R       C
m        o       o
u        a       y
s        d       o
                 t
         R       e
         o        
         l        
         s        

Example 2

INPUT:
N = 4
Team 1: Royal
Team 2: Mars
Team 3: De Rose
Team 4: Kings

OUTPUT:
R        M       D       K
o        a       e       i
y        r               n
a        s       R       g
l                o       s
                 s      
                 e      

Example 3

INPUT:
N = 10

OUTPUT:
