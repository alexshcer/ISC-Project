The result of a quiz competition is to be prepared as follows:

The quiz has five questions with four multiple choices (A, B, C, D), with each question carrying 1 mark for the correct answer. Design a program to accept the number of participants N such that N must be greater than 3 and less than 11. Create a double-dimensional array of size (Nx5) to store the answers of each participant row-wise. Calculate the marks for each participant by matching the correct answer stored in a single-dimensional array of size 5. Display the scores for each participant and also the participant(s) having the highest score.

Example: If the value of N = 4, then the array would be:
            	Q1	Q2	Q3	Q4	Q5
Participant 1	A	B	B	C	A
Participant 2	D	A	D	C	B
Participant 3	A	A	B	A	C
Participant 4	D	C	C	A	B
Key to the question:	D	C	C	B	A

Note: Array entries are line fed (i.e. one entry per line)

Test your program for the following data and some random data.

Example 1

INPUT:
N = 5
Participant 1 D A B C C
Participant 2 A A D C B
Participant 3 B A C D B
Participant 4 D A D C B
Participant 5 B C A D D
Key: B C D A A

OUTPUT:
Scores:
Participant 1 = 0
Participant 2 = 1
Participant 3 = 1
Participant 4 = 1
Participant 5 = 2
Highest Score:
Participant 5

Example 2

INPUT:
N = 4
Participant 1 A C C B D
Participant 2 B C A A C
Participant 3 B C B A A
Participant 4 C C D D B
Key: A C D B B

OUTPUT:
Scores:
Participant 1 = 3
Participant 2 = 1
Participant 3 = 1
Participant 4 = 3
Highest Score:
Participant 1
Participant 4

Example 3

INPUT:
N = 12

OUTPUT:
INPUT SIZE OUT OF RANGE.
