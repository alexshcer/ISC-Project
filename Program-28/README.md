- Step-5 :- Create a method named as `countDigits` to count the number of digits in the number.
- Step-6 :- Create a method named as `sumofDigits` with two interger type parameters to return the sum of the digits of the number.
- Step-7 :- Create a method named as `check` to check whether the number is a disarium number and display the result with an appropriate message.
- Step-8 :- Create a method named as `main` to to create an object and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
- Step-9 :- END
