Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either ‘.’, ‘?’ or ‘!’ only. The words are to be separated by a single blank space and are in uppercase.

Perform the following tasks:

(a) Check for the validity of the accepted sentence.

(b) Convert the non-palindrome words of the sentence into palindrome words by concatenating the word by its reverse (excluding the last character).

Example:

The reverse of the word HELP would be LEH (omitting the last alphabet) and by concatenating both, the new palindrome word is HELPLEH. Thus, the word HELP becomes HELPLEH.

Note: The words which end with repeated alphabets, for example ABB would become ABBA and not ABBBA and XAZZZ becomes XAZZZAX.

[Palindrome word: Spells same from either side. Example: DAD, MADAM etc.]

(c) Display the original sentence along with the converted sentence.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
THE BIRD IS FLYING.

OUTPUT:
THE BIRD IS FLYING.
THEHT BIRDRIB ISI FLYINGNIYLF

Example 2

INPUT:
